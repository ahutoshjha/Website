It's a proven fact that The UK looted 45 trillion USD from our country, Just think that how much the whole of Europe looted from the whole world. As we all know that money is volatile and Europeans knew that so they invest this money in science and technology and started the first two industrial revolutions and this industrial revolution become the reason for our collapse because we were the vessel state of Britishers so we did not get the chance to participate in the first two industrial revolutions. So, the question arises that: <i>India is underdeveloped because of Britishers</i> the answer is:<i> it does not matter.</i> The thing that matter, is to be proud in our ancestor and tries the be like them and to be proud we have to know the history mostly the ancient one in a proper manner and this website provide you the thing that matter the most i.e. the proud to our culture, our ancestor and our great nation.</h3> <fieldset><legend><h1>The Greatest Of the Great</h1></legend>

            <p><h3>Dragon is a mythical creature and known for his great strength and power,<i> popular web series Game of Thrones also mentioned about him.</i> In ancient times China was like a dragon a powerful and advanced civilization alike India. India and China used to contribute 50% of world GDP and the two are the most ancient civilization that existed until now. Unlike India, China also suffered due to colonial power even much worse than Indian and mostly by the Japanese. The fall of Indian civilization begins from the destruction of <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda ">Nalanda university</a>  The fall of the Chinese begin after the attack of Mongols from the Modern-day Mongolia and Kazakhstan. But the economical downfall of china begins after the opium war in which the Chinese lost and they had to buy the opium from Britishers which ultimately destroyed the intelligence of the Chinese population and thus the Chinese civilization collapse. During world war 2 the war atrocities were done by the Japanese shock anyone's soul especially the incident like <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre"> <i>Nanjing Massacre</i></a>.After world war 2 china involved in a civil war and because of this millions had been died.  But the china stand, because they never forgot what they were in their past and also because of one of the greatest leaders in Chinese history <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping">Deng xiaoping</a> who use this fact to motivate their countrymen to acheive the glory they had thousand years ago. A Great philospher once said that <i>The history repeat itself.</i> It repeated in case of China and it will be repeated in case of India too.</h3></p>

              <h3> My name is Ashutosh Jha and I was born in <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhubani,_India ">Madhubani</a>(<i>known for Arts And culture especially for Painting)</i>) in the region of <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithila_(region) ">Mithila</a> famous for Ramayan and for Maa Sita. I did my intial studies in my village and thus I know the value of my culture and how it's affect rest of my life.After that I came to <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naliya ">Naliya</a>, It's a small town, nice climate overall it's a nice place. I did my education upto 12th from <a target="_blank" href=" https://afsnaliya.kvs.ac.in/ ">Kendriya Vidyalaya AFS Naliya</a>. But I frequently visit my hometown in <a target="_blank"   href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar ">Bihar</a> whnever the vacation started and that's how I got to know about most of the ancient history especially the one related to <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra ">Pataliputra</a> & most of us know that the Pataliputra is called as the cradel of indian civilization. I am currently doing Engineering from <a target="_blank" href=" https://iitram.ac.in/ ">IITRAM</a> in <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat ">Gujarat</a>.  
             <i style="color: goldenrod;"> Science and Technology or Innovation is very necessary to acheive our ancient position and I expreince that to innovate in india one has to love this nation more then that of USA and Europe. For that: the knowldge of ancient history without adding the colonial feature is nessasary to learn. </i>
